# Sketchup-Extensions
Extensions to Trimble's Sketchup

## KLP_ChooseReferenceFace

This extension allows you to identify the selected edge and face as the arris and reference face of a timber. This extension is useful in Timber Framing.

## KLP_SolidsMakeShopDrawing

This extension will generate a shop drawing for the selected Timber Frame
component (which must be a solid).  It will identify other intersecting solids
and automatically "trim" these solids with the selected component (thus
creating mortises and peg holes in the drawings). The shop drawing will be
automatically saved in a separate Sketchup file and the current drawing remains
unchanged.

This extension requires a Sketchup Pro License since it operates on solid
components.
